# Installation Guide

The skill ships in a single canonical Claude / Agent-Skills format and is converted on
the fly to the shape each target tool expects. One installer (`./install.sh`) handles
the conversion for every supported tool. Per-tool blocks below are copy-pasteable.

## Prerequisites

- `git` (for clone / fetch - only required if running the installer remotely)
- `bash` 4+ (macOS / Linux / WSL)
- For the Claude Projects zip: `python3` or `zip`

## Quick reference: one installer, eleven tools

```bash
# Auto-detect tools in the current project / $HOME and install for each
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OptimNow/cloud-finops-skills/main/install.sh | bash

# Or install for a specific tool
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OptimNow/cloud-finops-skills/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --tool <name>

# Other useful flags
./install.sh --list              # list supported tools
./install.sh --dry-run           # print what would happen
./install.sh --user              # install at $HOME paths (Claude Code, Gemini CLI)
./install.sh --dest <dir>        # override target directory
```

Supported tools: `claude-code`, `claude-projects`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `chatgpt`,
`gemini`, `gemini-cli`, `codex`, `aider`, `copilot`, `kiro`.

## Per-tool blocks

### Claude Code (project)

```bash
./install.sh --tool claude-code
```

Copies the skill folder to `<project>/.claude/skills/cloud-finops/`. Restart Claude Code
or run `/reload-plugins` to pick up.

For auto-updating installs, prefer the plugin marketplace path:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/OptimNow/cloud-finops-skills.git
/plugin install cloud-finops@optimnow
/plugin update cloud-finops@optimnow
```

(Run those at the Claude Code prompt, not in a shell.)

### Claude Code (user-level)

```bash
./install.sh --tool claude-code --user
```

Copies to `~/.claude/skills/cloud-finops/` so the skill is available across all your
Claude Code projects.

### Claude Projects / claude.ai (web upload)

```bash
./install.sh --tool claude-projects
```

Builds `dist/claude-projects/cloud-finops.zip`. Upload via Claude.ai or Claude Desktop:
**Settings → Skills → Upload zip**.

The release workflow also attaches a version-tagged build
(`cloud-finops-vX.Y.Z.zip`) to every GitHub release - you can grab it from
https://github.com/OptimNow/cloud-finops-skills/releases without running the
installer locally.

### Cursor

```bash
./install.sh --tool cursor
```

Writes `<project>/.cursor/rules/cloud-finops.mdc` (single rule with the full skill body
+ Cursor frontmatter). Cursor auto-loads `.cursor/rules/`. Trigger by asking a FinOps
question in chat.

### Windsurf

```bash
./install.sh --tool windsurf
```

Writes `<project>/.windsurf/rules/cloud-finops.md` with Windsurf rule frontmatter
(`trigger: model_decision`).

### ChatGPT (Custom GPT)

```bash
./install.sh --tool chatgpt
```

Builds two artefacts in `dist/chatgpt/`:

- `instructions.md` - target ≤ 8000 chars; the routing logic, reasoning sequence, and
  response contract that go into the GPT's Instructions field. The installer warns if
  the file exceeds the limit.
- `knowledge/*.md` - **42 files** in the default per-reference build:
  - 27 reference files (one per domain; `optimnow-methodology.md` is **merged into
    `finops-for-ai.md`**)
  - 15 playbook files prefixed `playbook-<slug>.md` so they sort together in the
    GPT Knowledge UI
  - The instructions routing contract points named waste patterns
    (zombie NAT, snapshot sprawl, etc.) at `playbook-<slug>.md` and other queries at
    the matching reference filename

ChatGPT historically capped Custom GPT Knowledge at 20 files. If your upload is
rejected, re-run the installer with the grouped flag:

```bash
./install.sh --tool chatgpt --grouped
```

The grouped build still writes to `dist/chatgpt/` (so all the upload steps below still
apply) but emits a **10-file thematic bundle** (aws, azure, gcp, ai, data-platforms,
oci, cross-cutting, finops-discipline, playbooks, methodology) with a separate routing
contract that points at the grouped filenames. Same content, fewer files, easier
upload.

Then manually:

1. Open https://chatgpt.com/gpts/editor
2. Paste `dist/chatgpt/instructions.md` into the Instructions field
3. Upload all files from `dist/chatgpt/knowledge/` to the Knowledge section
4. Set name (`Cloud FinOps`), category, visibility per preference

**Public Custom GPT on the Roadmap.** A maintained public Cloud FinOps GPT is tracked
in the `Roadmap > In-flight` section of `CLAUDE.md`; until it ships, the self-host
path above is the supported install.

**Trade-off:** ChatGPT's 8K Instructions limit means routing + response contract live
inline, but the reference content is RAG-retrieved from Knowledge files. Compared to
the Claude / Cursor install, ChatGPT may miss cross-reference detail because it
retrieves chunks rather than loading the full skill into context.

### Gemini Gems (web)

```bash
./install.sh --tool gemini
```

Builds `dist/gemini/instructions.md` (a routing contract that points at the grouped
filenames) and `dist/gemini/knowledge/*.md` - **10 files** grouped by domain: aws,
azure, gcp, ai, data-platforms, oci, cross-cutting, finops-discipline, playbooks,
methodology. The `playbooks.md` bundle concatenates all named-pattern runbooks; the
instructions routing tells the model to look up the matching `## playbook: <slug>`
section inside it.

Manual upload at https://gemini.google.com/gems/. Same trade-off as ChatGPT applies.

**Public Gemini Gem on the Roadmap.** A maintained public Cloud FinOps Gem is
tracked in the `Roadmap > In-flight` section of `CLAUDE.md`; until it ships, the
self-host path above is the supported install.

### Gemini CLI

```bash
./install.sh --tool gemini-cli --user
```

Copies to `~/.gemini/skills/cloud-finops/`.

### OpenAI Codex CLI

```bash
./install.sh --tool codex
```

Writes `<project>/AGENTS.md` (or `AGENTS-cloud-finops.md` if `AGENTS.md` already exists,
to avoid clobbering). Codex CLI reads `AGENTS.md` as project-level context.

This is the interim path; an MCP server (planned) will be the cleaner cross-agent
distribution mechanism.

### Aider

```bash
./install.sh --tool aider
```

Writes `<project>/CONVENTIONS.md` (or `CONVENTIONS-cloud-finops.md` if one exists).
Aider auto-reads `CONVENTIONS.md`. Default coverage is the four general references
(AWS, Azure, GCP, AI). Add specific references at runtime with:

```bash
aider --read cloud-finops/references/finops-bedrock.md ...
```

### GitHub Copilot

```bash
./install.sh --tool copilot
```

Writes `<project>/.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Copilot's customisation surface
is shallow - the file informs code-suggestion context but won't power deep FinOps Q&A
the way Claude / Cursor do. Use as a lightweight context hint, not a full skill load.

### Kiro IDE

```bash
./install.sh --tool kiro
```

Copies the skill to `<project>/.kiro/powers/cloud-finops/`. Kiro uses `POWER.md` as the
entry point.

---

## Updating

```bash
./install.sh --tool <name>
```

Re-running the installer for a tool overwrites the previous install in place. The
script is idempotent - safe to run on every release.

For Claude Code plugin users:

```
/plugin update cloud-finops@optimnow
```

---

## API integration (system-prompt injection)

For direct API use without one of the supported tools, concatenate the skill files
into your system prompt. This is the model-agnostic path - works with any LLM API
(Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, others).

```python
import os

def load_cloud_finops_skill(skill_dir: str) -> str:
    skill_md = open(f"{skill_dir}/SKILL.md").read()
    sections = []

    # References (long-form provider / capability files)
    ref_dir = f"{skill_dir}/references"
    for filename in sorted(os.listdir(ref_dir)):
        if filename.endswith(".md"):
            content = open(f"{ref_dir}/{filename}").read()
            sections.append(f"## references/{filename}\n\n{content}")

    # Playbooks (named-pattern runbooks - SKILL.md routes named waste
    # patterns to playbooks/<slug>.md, so they must be loaded too)
    pb_dir = f"{skill_dir}/playbooks"
    if os.path.isdir(pb_dir):
        for filename in sorted(os.listdir(pb_dir)):
            if filename.endswith(".md") and filename != "README.md":
                content = open(f"{pb_dir}/{filename}").read()
                sections.append(f"## playbooks/{filename}\n\n{content}")

    return skill_md + "\n\n---\n\n" + "\n\n---\n\n".join(sections)

system_prompt = load_cloud_finops_skill("./cloud-finops")
```

For token efficiency, load only the references relevant to your use case. For most
single-domain queries, one reference file plus `optimnow-methodology.md` is sufficient.
The playbooks layer is small (~3 KB each) so loading the full set is usually cheap;
drop it only if your token budget is very tight.

### Recommended response contract

For non-Claude models, prepend this contract to your system prompt to keep responses
structured and grounded in the injected references:

```text
# Cloud FinOps Response Contract - by OptimNow
# https://github.com/OptimNow/cloud-finops-skills

You are a Cloud FinOps expert providing practical, business-aligned guidance
on cloud cost management, AI workload economics, and commitment strategy.

Your knowledge comes from injected reference documents covering provider-specific
billing mechanics, pricing models, and proven optimisation patterns. Rely on
the provided references when available. Do not invent pricing figures, discount
percentages, or billing rules.

RESPONSE CONTRACT
1) Context and positioning
- Identify the relevant cloud domain(s) and provider(s).
- State assumed maturity level (Crawl/Walk/Run) if the user does not specify.
- State assumptions explicitly.

2) Practical guidance
- Lead with how billing actually works before recommending actions.
- Distinguish quick wins from structural improvements.
- Avoid generic best-practice statements without grounding in billing mechanics.

3) Metrics and signals
- Use measurable indicators tied to the specific domain.
- If targets are unknown, provide directional guidance instead of fabricated numbers.

4) Business impact
- Connect recommendations to business outcomes, not just cost reduction.
- Clarify trade-offs and accountability implications.

5) Maturity awareness
- Tailor actions to the user's maturity level.
- Do not recommend advanced automation at Crawl unless explicitly requested.
- When relevant, show progression to the next maturity stage.

BEHAVIORAL RULES
- Do not hallucinate billing rules, pricing, or discount mechanics.
- If required information is missing from the references, state the limitation.
- If outside cloud cost or FinOps scope, say so briefly.
- Keep tone structured, professional, and concise.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Use headers:
- Context
- Recommendation
- Metrics and signals
- Business impact
Do not output JSON unless requested.
```

## Troubleshooting

**Skill not activating in Claude Code:** check that the YAML frontmatter in `SKILL.md`
is valid. The `name` and `description` fields are required.

**Cursor / Windsurf rule not triggering:** verify the rule's `description` field is
specific enough that the model picks it up. The default description in the installer
already covers the major FinOps query types.

**ChatGPT instructions exceed 8K limit:** the installer warns when the build crosses
the limit. If it does, manually trim the routing table to only the providers you care
about, or upload the trimmed routing as a knowledge file and keep instructions minimal.

**ChatGPT rejects the knowledge upload (file count):** the default build produces 42
knowledge files (27 references + 15 playbooks; methodology merged into
`finops-for-ai.md`). If ChatGPT enforces a lower cap, re-run with the grouped flag:
`./install.sh --tool chatgpt --grouped`. The grouped build packs the same content into
10 thematic files in `dist/chatgpt/` and emits a matching routing contract.

**Token budget exceeded on system-prompt injection:** load only the domain references
relevant to your query. For most use cases, `SKILL.md` + 1-2 references is enough.

**Path issues on Windows:** the installer is bash-only. Use WSL2 (`wsl.exe`) or Git
Bash. Native PowerShell is not supported.
