## GCP cost data foundation

### Cloud Billing reports and Cost Management console

GCP's native cost surface is the Cloud Billing console - reports, cost breakdowns,
budgets, and pricing tables - scoped to a Billing Account. For organisations with
multiple Billing Accounts, the Cloud Console aggregates across them but the data
contract sits at the Billing Account level.

**Set up before anything else:**
- [ ] Billing administrator IAM grants for the FinOps team
- [ ] Budgets with email + Pub/Sub alerts at 50% / 80% / 100% thresholds, per project
- [ ] BigQuery billing export enabled (see below) - this is the canonical analytics path
- [ ] Pricing data export to BigQuery for SKU price reconciliation

The Cloud Billing console is sufficient for ad-hoc visualisation and budget alerting.
For any serious FinOps analytics, the BigQuery billing export is the right primitive,
not the console.

### BigQuery billing export - the canonical GCP cost data path

GCP exposes three distinct exports to BigQuery, and they are not interchangeable:

| Export | What it contains | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| **Standard usage cost data** | Daily aggregated cost by service / SKU / project / label | Showback, budget tracking, executive reporting |
| **Detailed usage cost data** | Resource-level line items (per-resource cost), backfilled from when enabled | Allocation, attribution, anomaly investigation, FinOps deep dives |
| **Pricing data** | SKU price catalogue (list and discounted) | Validating CUD discounts, pricing-aware what-if analysis |

**Important nuances:**
- **Resource-level data is opt-in** and backfills only from the moment you enable it -
  not historically. Enable it on Day 1 of any new GCP engagement.
- **Detailed export schema differs from standard.** Queries built against `gcp_billing_export_v1_*` (standard)
  do not run unchanged against `gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_*` (detailed); both schemas
  evolve over time.
- **Credits appear as separate line items**, not as discounts on the parent line. CUD
  application, SUD application, and promotional credits each get their own rows -
  filter or aggregate carefully.

### FOCUS billing export

GCP supports a **FOCUS-conformant BigQuery export** for cross-cloud normalisation.
Configure it alongside (not instead of) the standard/detailed exports - the FOCUS
schema is optimised for multi-cloud joins, while the native exports retain GCP-
specific columns the FOCUS spec does not surface.

For multi-cloud customers normalising AWS / Azure / GCP cost in one warehouse, the
FOCUS export is the path that aligns with AWS Data Exports for FOCUS 1.2 (GA Nov 2025)
and Azure Cost Management's FOCUS 1.2 preview.

### Cloud Billing Pricing API

For pricing-aware analytics, use the **Cloud Billing Pricing API** to validate that
CUD-discounted rates match expectation, model what-if scenarios for re-architecture
proposals, and reconcile invoice line items. Pricing changes propagate to the API
within hours of the public price change.

### Kubernetes cost attribution and monitoring

For GKE workloads, native GCP billing data provides node-level costs but lacks
container-level granularity. Modern Kubernetes cost monitoring tools bridge this gap:

**Open-source options:**
- **OpenCost** - CNCF sandbox project providing real-time Kubernetes cost allocation,
  integrates with GCP billing APIs for accurate node pricing
- **Kubernetes Resource Report** - lightweight cost visibility without external dependencies

**Commercial solutions:**
- **Kubecost** - detailed namespace/deployment/pod cost allocation with efficiency
  recommendations
- **CloudZero** - unified Kubernetes and cloud cost platform with anomaly detection
- **Finout** - real-time cost attribution with custom business metrics mapping

**Key attribution patterns for GKE:**
- Label consistency between Kubernetes resources and GCP resources for unified reporting
- Namespace-based cost allocation aligned with team/project boundaries
- Pod resource requests/limits accuracy - overprovisioning at pod level compounds at
  cluster scale
- Shared resource allocation (system pods, ingress controllers) using weighted
  distribution models

**Industry benchmarks for rightsizing opportunities:**
As of March 2026, Cast AI's State of Kubernetes Resource Optimization report shows
typical Kubernetes clusters running at only 8% CPU utilisation and 20% memory
utilisation - down from 10% CPU and 23% memory in 2025. For GPU-enabled node pools,
utilisation tracking is now critical as GPU waste compounds the cost impact. These
benchmarks provide a baseline for identifying overprovisioned GKE workloads.

## Commitment discounts on GCP

GCP offers a different commitment model from AWS or Azure. There are no Reserved
Instances. The four levers are **Committed Use Discounts (CUDs)**, **Sustained Use
Discounts (SUDs)**, **Spot VMs**, and **Flex CUDs** (a recent spend-based addition).
SUDs are automatic; CUDs and Flex CUDs are explicit commitments; Spot is a market
mechanism.

### Sustained Use Discounts (SUDs) - free, automatic, often missed

SUDs apply automatically to Compute Engine VMs that run a significant portion of
the month. **No commitment, no purchase, no enrolment.** GCP discounts the on-demand
rate retroactively based on monthly run-time per VM family per region.

- Up to ~20% discount for a VM running 100% of a calendar month (general-purpose
  families)
- Discount is calculated per-resource and applied automatically on the next invoice
- Visible in BigQuery billing export as a separate line item with credit type
  `SUSTAINED_USAGE_DISCOUNT`

**Practical implication:** SUDs reduce the apparent saving from a 1-year CUD purchase
because the SUD discount is already baked into the on-demand rate the CUD compares
against. When sizing a CUD, model against the SUD-effective rate, not the headline
on-demand rate, to avoid overstating CUD savings.

Source: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/sustained-use-discounts

### Committed Use Discounts (CUDs) - resource-based vs spend-based

GCP CUDs come in two distinct flavours that are easy to conflate:

| CUD type | Commits to | Discount depth | Flexibility | Term |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Resource-based CUD** | Specific vCPU + memory in a region | Up to 57% (3yr) | Low - locked to machine series and region | 1yr or 3yr |
| **Spend-based / Flexible CUD** | $/hr spend on Compute Engine | **Up to 28% (1yr) or 46% (3yr)** | High - any machine series in any region | 1yr or 3yr |

**Resource-based CUDs** are the deeper-discount path for predictable, stable
workloads on a known machine series (N2, E2, etc.). The trade-off is rigidity -
they do not transfer if you migrate to a different series or to GKE / Cloud Run.

**Spend-based CUDs (Flexible CUDs)** are the spend-based equivalent of AWS Compute
Savings Plans or Azure Compute Savings Plans. Shallower discount than resource-
based CUDs at the same term, but they apply across machine series and regions and
survive architectural changes.

The **architectural drift trap** (already in the patterns section below) is the
most common GCP commitment failure: organisations buy resource-based CUDs early,
then migrate workloads to GKE Autopilot or Cloud Run, leaving the CUDs underused.
Spend-based CUDs avoid this category of failure at the cost of ~11 percentage
points of discount depth on 3-year terms (46% vs 57%).

**Layering recommendation (analogous to AWS / Azure layering):**

```
Layer 1: Spot VMs (interruptible workloads)
  ↓ removes 60-91% of compute cost on the spike layer
Layer 2: Spend-based CUDs (broad baseline across machine series)
  ↓ covers the predictable floor; survives migration
Layer 3: Resource-based CUDs (only for high-conviction stable workloads)
  ↓ adds the extra ~30% discount delta but locks you in
Layer 4: SUDs (automatic - no action)
  ↓ baseline retroactive discount on remaining on-demand
Layer 5: On-Demand (variable / new workloads)
```

CUDs cover **Compute Engine, GKE (via the underlying nodes), Cloud SQL, Cloud Run
(spend-based only), and Memorystore** depending on the CUD type. They do **not**
cover Cloud Functions, BigQuery, GCS, or Pub/Sub - those services have their own
commitment models (BigQuery slot reservations, etc.).

**CUD Sharing - the single most-missed CUD setting.** By default, CUD discounts
apply only **within the project that purchased them**. To pool CUDs across an
organisation - the typical multi-team / multi-project scenario - you must
explicitly enable **CUD Sharing** at the **billing-account level**. Without it,
one project burns its CUDs to zero while sibling projects pay PAYG, and the
billing-account-level coverage looks healthy in aggregate while individual
project-level utilisation is poor. Day-1 audit on any GCP commitment engagement:
verify whether CUD Sharing is enabled. Source:

### Compute SKU billing - vCPU and memory bill separately

GCP bills Compute Engine resources with the **vCPU and memory components on
separate SKUs**, unlike AWS where the EC2 instance is a single billable unit.
This is invisible in the console summary but explicit in BigQuery billing export -
a single VM produces multiple cost rows per day (one for vCPU, one for memory,
plus disk, network, licensing, sustained-use credits, etc.).

**Practical implications for cost analytics:**
- Aggregating "cost per VM" requires summing across SKUs, not reading a single
  line. Custom Power BI / BigQuery dashboards that treat one row = one resource
  will under-report.
- Right-sizing analysis must consider vCPU and memory independently - GCP's
  custom machine types let you tune the ratio, which AWS cannot match at the
  same granularity.
- CUDs apply to the vCPU and memory components separately; mixed coverage is
  possible (e.g. 100% vCPU CUD, 60% memory CUD) and shows as such in CUD
  utilisation reports.

### Spot VMs

Spot VMs (which superseded Preemptible VMs) offer **60-91% discount** off on-demand
pricing in exchange for:
- 30-second termination notice on preemption
- No SLA, no live migration

**No 24-hour maximum runtime.** Spot VMs can run indefinitely until preempted - the
24-hour cap was a property of the older Preemptible VM offering, not Spot. Long-
running batch jobs and training workloads with checkpointing are valid Spot
workloads.

Use for: batch jobs, ML training with checkpointing, CI/CD, fault-tolerant tiers.
Avoid for: stateful workloads, latency-sensitive APIs, anything that cannot tolerate
abrupt termination.

Source: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/spot

### BigQuery commitment model (separate from CUDs)

BigQuery has its own commitment model unrelated to Compute CUDs:

- **On-demand pricing:** $/TiB scanned
- **Capacity-based pricing:** slot reservations (Standard, Enterprise, Enterprise Plus
  editions). Reserve slots for predictable workload; Autoscaler scales up beyond the
  baseline at usage rates.
- **Slot commitments:** 1-year or 3-year for additional discount on top of the
  edition rate.

**The BigQuery cost trap** (in the patterns catalogue): teams adopt slot reservations
to stabilise costs, then query volumes drop and slots sit underused. The reservation
discount is wasted. Separately, **inefficient query design** (unpartitioned tables,
broad SELECT *, missing clustering) is often a 10-100x cost amplifier - fix the
queries before sizing the reservation.

## Cloud Carbon Footprint

GCP publishes per-project, per-region, per-service carbon emissions data through the
**Cloud Carbon Footprint** product. Both **location-based** and **market-based**
emissions methodologies are supported.

| Methodology | What it measures | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Location-based** | Average emissions intensity of the regional grid where compute runs | Comparing physical regions; reporting under GHG Protocol Scope 2 location-based |
| **Market-based** | Emissions accounting for Google's renewable energy purchases (PPAs, RECs) | Reporting under GHG Protocol Scope 2 market-based; Google's net-zero claims |

**Both views are exposed in the console and via BigQuery export.** For
sustainability reporting that needs to align with corporate Scope 2 disclosures,
choose the methodology that matches your accounting framework - they will produce
materially different numbers, especially in regions where Google has heavy renewable
PPAs.

**Practical FinOps integration:**
- Region selection has a carbon-cost trade-off: cheaper regions are sometimes higher-
  carbon (Asian regions vs European). Surface this in the architecture review, not
  just at procurement.
- The BigQuery carbon export joins to billing data on `project_id` + `service` +
  `region`, enabling carbon-per-dollar analytics for greenops dashboards.

See `greenops-cloud-carbon.md` for cross-provider GreenOps guidance.

## Inefficiency patterns catalogue

The remainder of this reference is a curated catalogue of 26 GCP inefficiency
patterns covering compute, storage, databases, networking, and operational
mechanics. Use these as a diagnostic checklist when building optimisation roadmaps.
Source: PointFive Cloud Efficiency Hub.

## Compute Optimization Patterns (10)

**Idle Gke Autopilot Clusters With Always On System Overhead**
Service: GCP GKE | Type: Inactive Resource Consuming Baseline Costs

Even when no user workloads are active, GKE Autopilot clusters continue running system-managed pods that accrue compute and storage charges. These include control plane components and built-in agents for observability and networking.

- Delete unused Autopilot clusters in dev, test, or sandbox environments
- Replace infrequently used workloads with serverless alternatives like Cloud Run or Cloud Functions
- Implement automation to tear down unused clusters after inactivity thresholds
- Use Kubernetes cost monitoring tools (OpenCost, Kubecost) to track system overhead vs workload costs
- Monitor cluster utilisation against industry benchmarks (as of March 2026: 8% CPU, 20% memory) to identify overprovisioned clusters

**Excessive Cold Starts In Gcp Cloud Functions**
Service: GCP Cloud Functions | Type: Inefficient Configuration

Cloud Functions scale to zero when idle. When invoked after inactivity, they undergo
