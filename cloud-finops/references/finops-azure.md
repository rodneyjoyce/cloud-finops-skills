## Azure cost data foundation

### Azure Cost Management exports

Azure Cost Management is the native cost visibility tool. For serious FinOps
implementations, configure scheduled exports to Azure Storage for downstream processing.

**Export types:**
- **Actual cost** - charges as they appear on the invoice (use for billing reconciliation)
- **Amortized cost** - reservation and savings plan charges spread across the usage period
  (use for team-level showback and allocation)

**Export setup checklist:**
- [ ] Configure FOCUS exports at **Billing Account** or **Billing Profile** scope (Management Group is not supported for FOCUS exports)
- [ ] For legacy actual/amortized exports, MG scope is supported but with limitations - keep them on subscription or billing-profile scope for cleanest behaviour
- [ ] Select both actual and amortized cost exports
- [ ] Set daily granularity
- [ ] Export to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for Power BI integration
- [ ] Consider FinOps Hubs (Microsoft FinOps Toolkit) for automated ingestion and normalization

**FOCUS export support (April 2026):**
- **Cost Management exports** support a **FOCUS 1.2 preview** dataset, with documented conformance gaps against the published 1.2 spec.
- **FinOps Toolkit v12 / FinOps Hubs** ingest the preview and provide FOCUS 1.2-aligned analytics on top.
- FOCUS 1.0 went GA in Cost Management in June 2024 - that remains the historical baseline; FOCUS 1.2 is the current direction. Configure for multi-cloud normalisation alongside traditional actual/amortized exports.

**Five first-class export feeds (FinOps Hubs model):** beyond actual/amortized and FOCUS, Cost Management produces three more feeds the FinOps Hubs model treats as first-class:
- **Price sheet** - negotiated price per meter, per Billing Profile
- **Reservation details** - purchases, terms, scope, utilisation
- **Reservation recommendations** - Microsoft's purchase suggestions
- **Reservation transactions** - purchase, exchange, refund history

All five feed the same Hub for unified reservation portfolio analytics. Source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-computing/finops/toolkit/hubs/finops-hubs-overview

### Retail Prices API for validation

Use the Azure Retail Prices API to verify EA discounts against public pricing. Useful for:
- Comparing PAYG vs Reserved Instance pricing with ROI calculation
- Evaluating Spot VM savings potential (60-90% off PAYG)
- Estimating database and storage tier costs across regions
- Validating that EA discount percentages match contracts

### FinOps Toolkit and FinOps Hubs

Microsoft's open-source FinOps Toolkit provides pre-built solutions including Power BI
report templates, Azure Workbooks, and FinOps Hubs for automated cost data ingestion.

**FinOps Hubs** normalize cost exports into a consistent schema and feed Power BI reports.
Recommended for organizations that want production-grade reporting without building custom
data pipelines. FinOps Hubs (Toolkit v12) ingest the **FOCUS 1.2 preview** from Cost
Management and provide 1.2-aligned analytics on top, enabling standardised multi-cloud
cost reporting (see "FOCUS export support" above for the layered preview vs GA picture).

### Azure Resource Graph for cost analysis

Azure Resource Graph (ARG) enables large-scale resource inventory and compliance analysis
with KQL queries. Use it for:
- VM analysis by family, OS disk type, hybrid benefit status
- Storage disk type summary (Premium, Standard SSD, Standard HDD, Ultra)
- Tagging compliance analysis with percentages
- Resource distribution by business unit/owner

## Commitment discounts

### Compute commitment instruments

Azure provides four distinct instruments for reducing compute costs, plus Azure Hybrid
Benefit which acts as a licensing overlay. As with AWS, these instruments are designed
to be layered, not chosen in isolation.

**Instrument comparison:**

| Instrument | Discount depth | Flexibility | Commitment type | Term | Covers |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Azure Reservation | Up to 72% | Lowest - locked to VM family, region, size | Capacity-based (specific SKU) | 1yr or 3yr | VMs, Dedicated Hosts, App Service (Isolated), specific services |
| Azure Savings Plan for Compute | Up to 65% | High - any VM family, region, size | Spend-based ($/hr) | 1yr or 3yr | VMs, Dedicated Hosts, Container Instances, App Service (Premium v3 / Isolated v2) |
| Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB) | Up to 40% (Windows), 55% (SQL) | Highest - no commitment, no lock-in | Licensing overlay | None | VMs, SQL Database, SQL MI, Red Hat/SUSE Linux |
| Spot Virtual Machines | Up to 90% | Variable - can be evicted with 30s notice | None (market-priced) | None | VMs, VMSS, AKS node pools |

**Critical distinctions:**

1. **Azure Hybrid Benefit is not a commitment - it is free money.** If you have Windows
   Server or SQL Server licenses with Software Assurance, AHB eliminates the license
   component from VM pricing. No contract, no lock-in, no restart needed. This should
   be enabled on all eligible VMs before any other commitment decision. Windows licence
   costs can account for 44% of a Windows VM price (e.g. D4_v5 Windows at ~0.35/hr =
   ~0.19 compute + ~0.15 licence). Use the AHB Workbook from FinOps Toolkit for
   compliance tracking across the fleet.

2. **Savings Plans for Compute cover more than VMs.** Unlike Reservations (which are
   resource-specific), Compute Savings Plans also cover Container Instances and App
   Service Premium v3 / Isolated v2. If you run a mix of VMs, containers, and App
   Service, a Compute Savings Plan is the only instrument that covers all three.

3. **Reservations offer deeper discounts but less flexibility.** A Reservation locks to
   a specific VM family and region. If you change instance family or region mid-term, the
   Reservation does not follow. A Savings Plan is spend-based and applies wherever it
   finds eligible usage - but the discount is ~7% shallower than a Reservation.

4. **Reservations have meaningful liquidity; Savings Plans have none.** See the liquidity
   mechanics table below for fees, caps, and operational rules. The takeaway: Microsoft's
   current reservation-liquidity terms are significantly more generous than AWS Standard
   RI marketplace selling, but read the fine print on the future 12% fee clause.

5. **Savings Plans cannot be exchanged, cancelled, or refunded** once purchased. The
   commitment runs for the full term. This makes phased purchasing and portfolio
   diversification critical for Savings Plans (see "Commitment portfolio liquidity" below).

6. **Spot is not a commitment** - it is a market mechanism with a 30-second eviction
   notice and no SLA. It belongs in the compute cost strategy but should not be compared
   directly against commitment instruments.

**Reservation and Savings Plan liquidity mechanics (current as of April 2026):**

| Mechanic | Fee | Annual cap | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Reservation exchange** | None | None | Same product family only. Does not count against the refund cap. The 1 January 2024 sunset of free exchanges was extended indefinitely; reservations purchased during the grace period (which is the current state as of April 2026) retain the right to one more exchange after the grace period eventually ends. |
| **Reservation refund (cancellation)** | None today | $50,000 per 12-month rolling window per Billing Profile (MCA) or enrollment (EA). **The cap restores day-by-day** - 365 days after a refund, the original $50K is fully reinstated. | "Refund" and "cancellation" are the same operation in current docs. Microsoft reserves the right to introduce a 12% early-termination fee in future - verify before relying on liquidity. |
| **Reservation trade-in to Savings Plan** | None | None | Convert RI to Savings Plan credit. No time limit. |
| **Savings Plan cancel / exchange / refund** | N/A | N/A | Not allowed. SPs are non-refundable, non-exchangeable, non-cancellable. |

### Compute commitment decision tree

```
START: What Azure compute service runs the workload?
│
├── Virtual Machines (including VMSS)
│   │
│   ├── Does the VM run Windows Server or SQL Server with SA licenses?
│   │   └── YES → Enable Azure Hybrid Benefit immediately (up to 40-55%
│   │             savings, no commitment, no restart). Then continue below
│   │             for additional commitment discounts on top of AHB.
│   │
│   ├── Is the workload fault-tolerant and interruptible?
│   │   ├── YES → Use Spot VMs (up to 90% discount)
│   │   │         - Start with 20-30% Spot allocation in non-production
│   │   │         - Use VMSS with Spot priority for auto-scaling pools
│   │   │         - Implement eviction handling (30-second notice)
│   │   │         - Good for: batch, dev/test, CI/CD, stateless tiers
│   │   │
│   │   └── NO → Is the workload stable and predictable (90+ days)?
│   │       ├── NO → Stay on PAYG. Re-evaluate quarterly.
│   │       │
│   │       └── YES → Has it been right-sized? (see Compute rightsizing below)
│   │           ├── NO → Right-size first. Do not commit to waste.
│   │           │
│   │           └── YES → Will it stay on the same VM family + region?
│   │               ├── YES → Azure Reservation (up to 72%)
│   │               │         Deepest discount. Can be exchanged for a
│   │               │         different SKU if workload changes (subject
│   │               │         to exchange policy limits).
│   │               │
│   │               └── NO / UNSURE → Savings Plan for Compute (up to 65%)
│   │                     Covers any VM family and region. ~7% shallower
│   │                     than Reservations but protects against family
│   │                     or region changes. Cannot be exchanged or
│   │                     refunded once purchased.
│   │
│   └── Special case: GPU / N-series VMs
│       - Capacity scarcity is a primary concern (NC, ND, NV families)
│       - Reservations may be necessary to secure capacity in constrained regions
│       - Savings Plans do not reserve capacity - only provide pricing benefit
│       - For ML training: consider Spot VMs with checkpointing
│       - For containerised GPU workloads: see AKS GPU optimisation below
│
├── Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
│   │
│   ├── AKS node pools run on VMs → commitment applies to underlying VMs
│   │   (use VM decision tree above for node pool instances)
│   │
│   ├── Spot node pools → use Spot priority for fault-tolerant pods
│   │   - Configure pod disruption budgets for graceful eviction
│   │   - Use taints/tolerations to isolate Spot-eligible workloads
│   │   - Can save 60-90% on non-critical node pools
│   │
│   ├── GPU node pools → special optimisation considerations
│   │   - Enable Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) for GPU-aware scheduling
│   │   - Use MPS (Multi-Process Service) for GPU sharing on NVIDIA GPUs
│   │   - Consider MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) for A100/H100 partitioning
│   │   - See "AKS GPU optimisation" section below for detailed guidance
│   │
│   └── Consider: cluster autoscaler + right-sized node pools before committing
│       Pod rightsizing (VPA) saves 20-40%; node pool rightsizing saves 15-30%.
│       Commit after these optimisations are stable, not before.
│
├── App Service
│   │
│   ├── Consumption Plan → no commitment needed (pay per execution)
│   │
│   ├── Premium v3 / Isolated v2 → Savings Plan for Compute applies
│   │   - Only relevant if App Service spend is significant (>$2K/month)
│   │   - Reservations also available for Isolated tier
│   │
│   └── Legacy plans (V2) → migrate to V3 first for better price-performance,
│       then evaluate commitment on the new tier
│
├── Azure Functions
│   │
│   ├── Consumption Plan → pay per execution, no commitment available
│   │   - Focus on optimising execution duration and memory allocation
│   │
│   ├── Premium Plan → runs on App Service infrastructure
│   │   Savings Plan for Compute applies. But first: does the workload
│   │   actually need Premium? Move non-critical functions to Consumption
│   │   Plan before committing to Premium.
│   │
│   └── Dedicated (App Service Plan) → same as App Service above
│
├── Container Instances
│   │
│   └── Savings Plan for Compute covers Container Instances
│       - Only worth committing if usage is sustained and predictable
│       - For short-lived or burst containers, PAYG is usually cheaper
│
└── Azure Databricks
    │
    └── Databricks has its own commitment model (DBCU pre-purchase)
        - Separate from Azure Reservations and Savings Plans
        - See finops-databricks.md for Databricks-specific guidance
```

### Savings Plan vs Reservation - detailed comparison

| Dimension | Azure Reservation | Azure Savings Plan for Compute |
|---|---|---|
| Commitment | Specific SKU for 1yr or 3yr | $/hr spend for 1yr or 3yr |
| Discount depth | Up to 72% | Up to 65% |
| VM family | Locked to one family | Any family |
| Region | Locked to one region | Any region |
| Size | Flexible within family (instance size flexibility) | Any size |
| Covers App Service | Premium v3 + Isolated v2 | App Service & Functions Premium plans (broader SKU set) |
| Covers Container Instances | No | Yes |
| Exchangeable | Yes - same product family, no fee, no cap (does not count against the refund cap) | No |
| Refundable | Pro-rated, up to $50K per 12 months - no fee today; Microsoft reserves right to add 12% future fee | No |
| Cancellable | Yes - refund and cancellation are the same operation today, no fee currently charged | No |
| Payment options | Monthly or Upfront | Monthly or Upfront |
| Scoping | Subscription, resource group, management group, shared | Subscription, resource group, management group, shared |

**Key takeaway:** Reservations offer deeper discounts AND more liquidity (exchanges,
refunds) but lock you to a specific VM family and region. Savings Plans offer shallower
discounts with NO liquidity but maximum flexibility across families and regions. For
stable workloads,
