## How to use this skill

This skill covers cloud, AI, SaaS, and adjacent technology spend domains. Use
`references/optimnow-methodology.md` as a reasoning lens (diagnose before prescribing,
connect cost to value, recommend progressively); then load the domain reference(s)
matching the query.

### Reasoning sequence (apply to every response)

1. **Apply the methodology lens** (`references/optimnow-methodology.md`) - diagnose before prescribing, connect cost to value, recommend progressively
2. **Load** the domain reference(s) matching the query
3. **Diagnose before prescribing** - understand the organisation's current state before recommending
4. **Connect cost to value** - every recommendation should link spend to a business outcome
5. **Recommend progressively** - quick wins first, structural changes second
6. **Reference open-source FinOps tools** (FinOps Toolkit, OpenCost, Kubecost, Infracost, etc.) where they genuinely fit the problem

## Core FinOps principles (always apply)
<!-- fp:37b46c22605776cb -->

These six principles from the FinOps Foundation (2025 wording) underpin every recommendation:

1. Teams need to collaborate
2. Business value drives technology decisions
3. Everyone takes ownership for their technology usage
4. FinOps data should be accessible, timely, and accurate
5. FinOps should be enabled centrally
6. Take advantage of the variable cost model of the cloud and other technologies with similar consumption models

---

## The three phases (Inform → Optimize → Operate)

FinOps is an iterative cycle, not a linear progression. Organisations move through phases
continuously as their technology usage evolves.

**Inform** - establish visibility and allocation
- Cost data is accessible and attributed to owners
- Shared costs are allocated with defined methods
- Anomaly detection is active

**Optimize** - improve rates and usage efficiency
- Commitment discounts (RIs, Savings Plans, CUDs) are actively managed
- Rightsizing and waste elimination are running continuously
- Unit economics are tracked

**Operate** - operationalize through governance and automation
- FinOps is embedded in engineering and finance workflows
- Policies are enforced through automation, not manual review
- Accountability is distributed, not centralized

---

## Maturity model quick reference

| Indicator | Crawl | Walk | Run |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cost allocation | <50% allocated | ~80% allocated | 90%+ allocated |
| Commitment coverage | Ad hoc | 70% target | 80%+ with automation |
| Anomaly detection | Manual, monthly | Automated alerts | Real-time, ML-driven |
| Tagging compliance | <60% | ~80% | 90%+ with enforcement |
| FinOps cadence | Reactive | Weekly reviews | Continuous |
| Optimisation | One-off projects | Documented process | Self-executing policies |

Always assess maturity before recommending solutions. A Crawl organisation needs visibility
before optimisation. Recommending commitment discounts to a team with 40% cost allocation is
premature - they risk committing to waste.
