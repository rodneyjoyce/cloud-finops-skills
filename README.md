## What is a Skill, and why does it matter

A Skill is a structured knowledge file that you attach to an AI agent or a large language
model. It gives the model accurate, domain-specific context that it would not otherwise
have access to.

Without it, general-purpose LLMs make confident but incorrect statements on FinOps topics.
They miscalculate PTU break-even rates. They confuse Azure and AWS reservation mechanics.
They give generic advice that ignores how billing actually works on Bedrock or Azure OpenAI.
The answers sound plausible. Most of the time, they are wrong on the details that matter.

This skill corrects that by injecting verified, curated FinOps knowledge directly into the
model's context - covering billing models, cost allocation patterns, optimisation
frameworks, and governance practices across the major cloud providers and AI platforms.

**The closest analogy is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).** Like RAG, it extends a
model's knowledge beyond its training data. Unlike RAG, it requires no vector database,
no embedding pipeline, and no retrieval infrastructure. You copy a folder into your agent
setup and the model gains structured expertise on cloud financial management.

This makes it portable: the same skill works with Claude, GPT, Gemini, or any
MCP-compatible agent - with no changes to the files.

To keep responses consistent across models, add a **response contract** to your
system prompt (see `INSTALLATION.md`, "API integration / Recommended response
contract"). This ensures structured, billing-grounded answers even when model
defaults differ.

---

## Who this is for

- **FinOps practitioners** building or evaluating AI-assisted cost analysis tools
- **Cloud engineers and architects** who want a cost-aware assistant integrated into
  their workflow
- **Developers** building internal FinOps agents, chatbots, or automation pipelines
- **Finance and IT managers** evaluating the AI tooling their teams are deploying

No AI infrastructure experience is required to use this skill. If you can copy a folder
and follow the installation steps, you can add FinOps expertise to any compatible agent.

---

- **Microsoft Fabric** - capacity FinOps (F-SKU model, Capacity Units, 24-hour CU smoothing, throttling), pause / resume, Reserved Capacity, the Pro/PPU to Fabric migration governance trap, shared-capacity allocation models, Capacity Metrics app
- **Snowflake** - warehouse optimisation, query tuning, storage, credits, QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY, Budgets including AI feature budgets, Cortex governance, resource monitor scope limit

  cost attribution with LiteLLM proxy, seat + usage vs BYOK architecture comparison,
  optimisation levers, cross-tool spend overlap audit
- **OCI** - compute, storage, networking optimisation
- **SaaS asset management (SAM)** - SaaS discovery, license optimization, renewal
  governance, SaaS Management Platforms (SMPs), shadow IT detection, sprawl patterns,
  and the connection to AI transition readiness
- **ITAM collaboration** - FinOps-ITAM joint operating model, BYOL cost mechanics,
  marketplace channel governance, Tier 1 vendor co-management, consumption-based SaaS
  overage monitoring, entitlement integration, and maturity framework
- **GreenOps and cloud carbon** - carbon measurement tooling, FinOps-to-GreenOps
  integration, carbon-aware workload shifting, region selection, GHG Protocol reporting
- **Anomaly management** - cost anomaly detection as a standalone Inform-phase
  capability: AWS Cost Anomaly Detection / Azure / GCP native tooling, threshold
  philosophy (absolute dollars plus percentage), layered detection across service,
  region, account, and tag scopes, the masked-anomaly failure mode, new-region
  detection, integration with Security
- **Allocation and showback** - cost allocation methodology and the showback
  delivery model that earns the upgrade to chargeback. FOCUS cost columns
  (`EffectiveCost` vs `BilledCost`) with explicit AWS legacy mapping (amortised
  vs unblended) and a `blended_cost` trap warning. Defensible allocation keys
  table, shared-services hard cases (network, observability, security, ingress),
  `InvoiceId` reconciliation, unallocated spend > 10% as a tagging signal,
  showback report design and routing into team-existing surfaces, data-quality
  dispute process
- **Chargeback** - soft-to-hard chargeback maturity ladder built on top of
  allocation and showback. Covers the Finance and accounting prerequisites
  that determine whether hard chargeback is operationally possible at all:
  ERP readiness (SAP CO cycles, Oracle / Workday / NetSuite equivalents),
  inter-BU P&L impact and incentive-plan alignment, CFO sponsorship as a
  hard requirement, transfer pricing for intercompany cloud recharges
  (cost-plus methodology, re-characterisation risk), cross-border tax
  mechanics (VAT reverse-charge, withholding, permanent-establishment risk,
  EU/OECD Pillar 2 minimum tax, US GILTI/FDII/BEAT), SOX-equivalent controls,
  decision-owner table mapping each prerequisite to the right Finance role,
  methodology dispute process, the chargeback-revolt anti-pattern (12-18
  months of credibility loss when skipped)
- **Onboarding workloads** - migration-time cost hygiene as the cheapest
  moment to enforce tagging, allocation, forecasting, and commitment-strategy
  alignment. Covers the intake gate (mandatory checklist + three
  implementation patterns: PR gate, cutover gate, pre-prod gate), the 60-90
  day forecast-then-commit rule that prevents committing on a volatile
  baseline, the double-bubble cost (parallel-run source and target) with
  explicit shutoff discipline, the migration-cost-estimate-vs-actuals trap
  driven by data-centre-to-cloud network cost differences, M&A integration
  playbook (months 1-12 sequence), FOCUS-during-migration logic, cost-aware
  architecture review integration, the requirement for a named
  post-migration FinOps owner
- **Kubernetes FinOps** - the cross-cluster discipline (EKS, GKE, AKS) for
  the hardest variant of cloud-cost allocation. Covers tooling choice
  (OpenCost / Kubecost / cloud-native), FOCUS-emitting K8s allocation with
  K8s-labels-to-FOCUS-Tags mapping (so per-pod costs join non-K8s costs in
  the warehouse), container rightsizing methodology (VPA in
  recommendation-only mode, p99 + 30% memory safety margin, p95 + 50% CPU
  safety, per-workload rollout), node-level autoscaling (Karpenter beats
  Cluster Autoscaler on cost efficiency where available, consolidation
  policy tuning, Pod Disruption Budgets as non-negotiable, Spot
  diversification across instance types and availability zones), and idle
  node cost as Platform team overhead rather than redistributed across
  application teams. Provider-specific node mechanics live in the per-cloud
  files
- **Waste detection playbooks** - OptimNow's seven-category waste taxonomy
  (orphaned, idle, overprovisioned, commitment mismatches, schedule
  blindness, modernization opportunities, AI/ML inefficiency) covering
  the detection patterns, two-signal classification rule, three-tier
  confidence model (obvious / likely / possible), and realised-vs-potential
  savings discipline. Operationally backed by the OptimNow WasteLine
  appliance for AWS (49 deterministic detection rules, read-only, with
  proposal-only remediation artifacts); for Azure and GCP, points to the
  in-cloud pattern catalogues. Crawl/Walk/Run progression from manual
  quarterly hunt to continuous Fargate-scheduled detection

All guidance is framed through OptimNow's methodology: connecting cost to business value,
diagnosing before prescribing, and recommending actions matched to organisational maturity.

---

## Design principles

- **AI cost management is a first-class domain.** Most FinOps resources treat AI workloads
  as an edge case. This skill treats them as a primary concern, with dedicated reference
  files for each major AI platform.
- **Visibility before optimisation.** The skill follows a consistent sequence: establish
  what you are spending, understand what is driving it, then act. It does not recommend
  optimisation steps before the visibility preconditions are met.
- **Practical over theoretical.** Guidance is based on how billing actually works and
  what has proven effective in enterprise delivery - not on what the documentation implies.
- **Maturity-sensitive.** Recommendations reflect the organisation's current state.
  A team with no cost allocation in place receives different guidance than a team
  evaluating cross-account chargeback models.
- **Tool-aware where relevant.** The skill references OptimNow's open-source tools
  (MCP for Tagging, AI ROI Calculator, FinOps Maturity Assessment) when they directly
  apply to the question at hand.

## Usage examples

These questions illustrate what this skill is designed to answer accurately.
A general-purpose LLM without this skill will produce plausible but unreliable answers
to most of them - particularly on billing mechanics, capacity economics, and
provider-specific behaviour.

The `SKILL.md` file is the entry point for Claude Code and generic agents. `POWER.md` is
the entry point for Kiro IDE. Both route queries to the same reference files - the
domain-specific content is shared.

---

## Installation

The skill installs into 11 different tools via a single bash installer that converts
the canonical Claude / Agent-Skills format into each target tool's expected shape.
See **[INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md)** for the full per-tool instructions.

### One-liner (auto-detect)

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OptimNow/cloud-finops-skills/main/install.sh | bash
```

Auto-detects which tools you have installed (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, etc.)
and installs the skill for each, with the right per-tool conversion.

### One specific tool

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OptimNow/cloud-finops-skills/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --tool <name>
```

Supported tools: `claude-code`, `claude-projects`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `chatgpt`,
`gemini`, `gemini-cli`, `codex`, `aider`, `copilot`, `kiro`. Run `./install.sh --list`
to see them all.

### Claude Code plugin (auto-updating alternative)

For Claude Code specifically, the skill is also distributed as a self-hosted plugin
with built-in update via `/plugin update`. Two commands at the **Claude Code prompt**
(not your shell):

```text
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/OptimNow/cloud-finops-skills.git
/plugin install cloud-finops@optimnow
```

To pull the latest content (including the twice-monthly automated updates):

```text
/plugin update cloud-finops@optimnow
```

**Note on the URL form:** the explicit HTTPS URL above avoids an SSH-authentication
prompt that some Claude Code installs hit when given the `OptimNow/cloud-finops-skills`
shorthand. The repository is fully public over HTTPS - no credentials needed.

### Claude Desktop / claude.ai

For the web / desktop apps, the installer can build a clean upload zip:

```bash
./install.sh --tool claude-projects
```

Then upload `dist/claude-projects/cloud-finops.zip` via Settings → Skills → Upload zip.
A version-tagged build (`cloud-finops-vX.Y.Z.zip`) is also attached to every
[GitHub release](https://github.com/OptimNow/cloud-finops-skills/releases) for
users who prefer downloading over building locally.

---

## This skill is actively maintained

This is a living repository. Reference files are refreshed twice a month (around the
1st and the 15th), driven by an automated scan of 29 data sources - cloud provider
pricing pages, release notes, billing changelogs, and FinOps community publications.
Changes are reviewed before being applied, so the content reflects verified updates
rather than raw feed output.

AI cost management is moving particularly fast - new model releases, capacity options, and
billing mechanics appear every few weeks. Watch or star this repo to be notified when
updates are published.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you spot an inaccuracy, a missing provider feature, or a
gap in coverage, open an issue or submit a pull request.

To suggest improvements:

1. Review the source material at [finops.org/framework](https://www.finops.org/framework/)
2. Identify gaps or inaccuracies in existing reference files
3. Submit a pull request with proposed changes
4. For new domains, follow the structure of an existing reference file as a template

---

## Adapting this skill for your organisation

Fork this repository and customise the reference files for your organisation's context:
your cloud stack, your internal policies, your tag taxonomy, your preferred methodology.

A fork gives you a stable base that you can pull upstream updates into at your own pace,
without overwriting your customisations. Typical customisations include:

- Adding organisation-specific tag requirements to `finops-tagging.md`
- Replacing generic pricing examples with your negotiated rates
- Adding reference files for internal tools or platforms not covered here
- Adjusting the methodology file to reflect your team's own approach
