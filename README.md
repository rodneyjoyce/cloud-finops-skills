## What is a Skill, and why does it matter

A Skill is a structured knowledge file that you attach to an AI agent or a large language
model. It gives the model accurate, domain-specific context that it would not otherwise
have access to.

Without it, general-purpose LLMs make confident but incorrect statements on FinOps topics.
They miscalculate PTU break-even rates. They confuse Azure and AWS reservation mechanics.
They give generic advice that ignores how billing actually works on Bedrock or Azure OpenAI.
The answers sound plausible. Most of the time, they are wrong on the details that matter.

This skill corrects that by injecting verified, curated FinOps knowledge directly into the
model's context - covering billing models, cost allocation patterns, optimisation
frameworks, and governance practices across the major cloud providers and AI platforms.

**The closest analogy is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).** Like RAG, it extends a
model's knowledge beyond its training data. Unlike RAG, it requires no vector database,
no embedding pipeline, and no retrieval infrastructure. You copy a folder into your agent
setup and the model gains structured expertise on cloud financial management.

This makes it portable: the same skill works with Claude, GPT, Gemini, or any
MCP-compatible agent - with no changes to the files.

To keep responses consistent across models, add a **response contract** to your
system prompt (see `INSTALLATION.md`, "API integration / Recommended response
contract"). This ensures structured, billing-grounded answers even when model
defaults differ.

---

## Who this is for

- **FinOps practitioners** building or evaluating AI-assisted cost analysis tools
- **Cloud engineers and architects** who want a cost-aware assistant integrated into
  their workflow
- **Developers** building internal FinOps agents, chatbots, or automation pipelines
- **Finance and IT managers** evaluating the AI tooling their teams are deploying

No AI infrastructure experience is required to use this skill. If you can copy a folder
and follow the installation steps, you can add FinOps expertise to any compatible agent.

---

## Design principles

- **AI cost management is a first-class domain.** Most FinOps resources treat AI
  workloads as an edge case. This skill treats them as a primary concern, with
  dedicated reference files for each major AI platform.
- **Visibility before optimisation.** The skill follows a consistent sequence:
  establish what you are spending, understand what is driving it, then act. It does
  not recommend optimisation steps before the visibility preconditions are met.
- **Provider-mechanics-first, vendor-claim-skeptical.** Guidance is grounded in how
  billing actually works (CUR columns, Azure cost-management semantics, BigQuery
  export, FOCUS conformance) rather than in vendor marketing or framework
  positioning. Vendor sustainability and savings claims are read critically, with
  primary sources cited.
- **Maturity is contextual, not aspirational.** Verticals where cloud is not a
  revenue generator do not need to reach Run; Crawl plus selective Walk is the right
  state when cloud is a cost centre. Verticals where cloud IS the product need Run
  because cloud efficiency directly drives gross margin. Pushing every organisation
  toward the same maturity ceiling is malpractice.
- **Connect cost to business value.** Every recommendation answers the CFO test:
  what business outcome does this protect or unlock. Cost reduction without a value
  lens is a leak.
- **FinOps is an operating discipline, not a culture.** The discipline lives in
  allocation, anomaly management, commitment management, rightsizing, and
  governance, all of which produce measurable outputs. "Culture of FinOps" framing
  tends to substitute slideware for those outputs. In the agentic era this matters
  more, not less: agents execute discipline, not culture.

These principles will grow into a `cloud-finops/doctrine/` directory of opposable
theses with their own primary sources; see the `Roadmap` section of `CLAUDE.md`.

## Usage examples

These questions illustrate what this skill is designed to answer accurately.
A general-purpose LLM without this skill will produce plausible but unreliable answers
to most of them - particularly on billing mechanics, capacity economics, and
provider-specific behaviour.

## Installation details

The "Install in 5 seconds" table at the top of this README covers the one-step path
for every supported tool. For per-tool blocks, troubleshooting, the model-agnostic
API loader, and the recommended response contract, see
**[INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md)**.

A version-tagged release zip (`cloud-finops-vX.Y.Z.zip`) is attached to every
[GitHub release](https://github.com/OptimNow/cloud-finops-skills/releases) for
Claude Desktop / claude.ai users who prefer downloading over building locally.

### MCP server (cross-tool, search-style retrieval)

For agents that want tool-style retrieval rather than full-context injection, the
skill is also published as an MCP server (`cloud-finops-mcp` on PyPI):

```bash
pip install cloud-finops-mcp
./install.sh --tool mcp     # prints config snippets for every MCP-aware client
```

Six tools across two surfaces. **References** (long-form provider/discipline files):
`list_references`, `get_reference`, `find_references` (faceted by FinOps
Capability/Phase). **Playbooks** (small named-pattern runbooks): `list_playbooks`,
`get_playbook`, `find_playbooks` (faceted by scope / service / waste category /
confidence). Wires into Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Windsurf, Cline, and any
other MCP-aware client. See [mcp_server/](./mcp_server/README.md) and the
[INSTALLATION.md MCP section](./INSTALLATION.md#mcp-server-cross-tool).

---

## This skill is actively maintained

This is a living repository. Reference files are refreshed twice a month (around the
1st and the 15th), driven by an automated scan of 29 data sources - cloud provider
pricing pages, release notes, billing changelogs, and FinOps community publications.
Changes are reviewed before being applied, so the content reflects verified updates
rather than raw feed output.

AI cost management is moving particularly fast - new model releases, capacity options, and
billing mechanics appear every few weeks. Watch or star this repo to be notified when
updates are published.

---

## Contributing

**Process and credit.** Open an issue first for anything larger than a typo or
single fact correction, so we can scope before you write. Pull requests should
keep the existing structure of the file you are touching, follow the conventions
in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) (FCP frontmatter, no em dashes, British spelling
in prose, license footer), and pass the FCP coverage check
(`./scripts/fcp-coverage.sh --check`).

You keep authorship: every contribution lives in the commit history under your
name and shows up in `git blame`. Substantive contributors are visible in the
repo's contributors list on GitHub.

**License and what that means for you.** All contributions are licensed under
[CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). This is an
OptimNow-maintained repo, but CC BY-SA was chosen specifically so anyone -
including you - can fork, customise, and redistribute under their own brand,
as long as they credit and share-alike. If you want a project under your own
name rather than contributing here, fork freely; see "Adapting this skill for
your organisation" below for the fork playbook. Both paths are first-class.

Practitioner experience is the highest-value contribution. Frameworks and
vendor docs are already public; what is rare is "we tried X in production,
this is what actually billed". Issues and PRs that bring that lens are welcome
in any of the layers below.

**Concrete contribution types we actively want:**

- **Pricing or billing-mechanic correction.** A CUR column name we got wrong, a
  CUD / Reservation discount depth that has shifted, a refund cap that does not
  match the latest contract terms. Cite the primary source (provider doc, your
  invoice, an enrollment agreement) so the change is verifiable.
- **New named playbook.** A waste pattern you see in the field that is not yet in
  `cloud-finops/playbooks/`. Follow the format documented in
  [`playbooks/README.md`](./cloud-finops/playbooks/README.md): symptoms / detection
  query / fix / anti-pattern / sources, ~2-4 KB. Examples we'd love: Lambda
  cold-start sprawl, Bedrock model proliferation, Snowflake warehouse fragmentation,
  Databricks all-purpose-cluster default-on, Cloud Run min-instance creep.
- **Fix or enrich an existing playbook.** A detection query that returns
  false positives in your data, an anti-pattern you saw burn a team, a fix step
  that does not work without a precondition we missed.
- **Pick up a deferred reference file.** The `Roadmap > Deferred reference
  files` section of [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) lists the P2/P3 items
  (forecasting, unit economics, practice operations, education & enablement,
  benchmarking, cost warehouse) with the rationale and trigger to revisit.
  If your engagement has surfaced one of those, that is the trigger - open
  an issue with the engagement context and we will scope the file together.
- **Tool installer addition.** Adding `--tool <new-tool>` for a coding
  assistant or agent we do not yet support. Match the existing
  installer pattern in `install.sh` (idempotent, dry-run-safe, exclude
  local-only files like `.claude/` and `.backups/`).
- **Real-world case study or counter-example.** Something you tried that did
  not work, or worked under conditions we do not flag. These end up as
  anti-pattern blocks in the relevant reference or playbook.
- **Adversarial review.** Disagreement on a recommendation, with reasoning
  and ideally a source. The repo is opinionated; it should also be falsifiable.
- **Bug report.** Installer fails on your setup, a file does not render in your
  tool, a guard rail false-positives. Open an issue with the exact command and
  output.
- **Translation.** Selected references in another language, maintained as a
  parallel directory rather than a fork, when you can commit to keeping them
  in sync with the next refresh.

**What we push back on:**

- Vendor marketing material restated as fact, without a primary source or
  practitioner-grade evidence behind the claim.
- Wholesale AI-generated reference content with no human practitioner pass.
  The pipeline that powers the twice-monthly refresh has hard guard rails (see
  the `Lessons learned` section of `CLAUDE.md` for why). Hand-written
  contributions go through human review for the same reasons.
- "Best practices" lists with no business-value framing. Every recommendation
  in this repo connects cost to a business outcome; contributions should follow
  that pattern.

## Adapting this skill for your organisation

Fork this repository and customise the reference files for your organisation's context:
your cloud stack, your internal policies, your tag taxonomy, your preferred methodology.

A fork gives you a stable base that you can pull upstream updates into at your own pace,
without overwriting your customisations. Typical customisations include:

- Adding organisation-specific tag requirements to `finops-tagging.md`
- Replacing generic pricing examples with your negotiated rates
- Adding reference files for internal tools or platforms not covered here
